//! \brief  8-bit CRC
//
// o CRC implementation is based on tables. If the tables
//   are calculated on the fly, the macro GEN_CRC_TABLES shall be defined
//   and genCRC8Tables() shall be called during 
//   initialization. If the macro is not defined, pre-calculated tables will
//   will be used. Using the latter option can put the tables to flash.
