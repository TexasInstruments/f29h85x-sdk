// In cases where the inputs need to be bit-reversed
// The C LUT approach handles this through a Reflected table, without the 
// need to explicitly bit reverse the inputs prior to providing them to the 
// CRC compute - this is for the C LUT approach)
// for the Asm approach, the architecture is able to be configured to bit 
// reverse the inputs - so again, there is no need to explicitly bit 
// reverse the inputs
