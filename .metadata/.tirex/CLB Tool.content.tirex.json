In this application report, a simple custom digital logic system is designed and tested. Each configurable block inside the CLB module is examined and set up to implement the desired custom system"

		"description": "The Configurable Logic Block (CLB) reduces total system cost and enhances functionality by absorbing external logic into C2000â„¢ microcontrollers. CLB uses function calls and a GUI-based programming tool called SysConfig to absorb external logic into the microcontroller without having to learn Hardware Description Language like VHDL or Verilog. This Report shows programmers, hardware engineers and system designers how to translate FPGA- or CPLD-based custom logic (that has been originally defined in HDL) to a CLB form that can be programmed into C2000 MCUs."
